# h1 Form submission:
-If the person needs help he/she can submit the form in the need help section and we will find a volunteer to help him/her with the task. The submitted data is stored on mongoDb and
can be retrieved later for further use. A mail is sent to the concerned user that his help has been accepted

# h1 Form acceptance:
-The submitted forms are then transferred to the volunteers who help the people. They can then accept the request for help from anyone who requires help. A mail is sent to the user when a volunteer accepts the userâ€™s request.
